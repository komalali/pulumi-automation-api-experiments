# Inline Program

This program demonstrates how to build a terminal UI on top of Pulumi's Automation API.

To run this example you'll need a few pre-reqs:
1. A Pulumi CLI installation ([v3.0.0-beta.2](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/versions/) or later)
2. The AWS CLI, with appropriate credentials.

Running this program is just like any other typescript program. No invocation through the Pulumi CLI required:

```shell
$ yarn build // installs deps and runs tsc
$ yarn start // runs node ./bin/index.ts
```
