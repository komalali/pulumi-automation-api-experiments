# Bubble Tea and Pulumi

This program experiments with building a custom terminal UI for Pulumi using [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea). 

To run this example you'll need a few pre-reqs:
1. A Pulumi CLI installation ([v2.10.1](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/versions/) or later)
2. The AWS CLI, with appropriate credentials.

Running this program is just like any other Go program. No invocation through the Pulumi CLI required:

```shell
$ go run main.go
```
